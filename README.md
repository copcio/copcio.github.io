# Version

This document defines Cloud Optimized Point Cloud (COPC) version **1.0**.

This document is available as a PDF at [copc-specification-1.0.pdf](copc-specification-1.0.pdf).

# Introduction

A COPC file is a LAZ 1.4 file that stores point data organized in a clustered
octree. It contains a VLR that describe the octree organization of data that
are stored in LAZ 1.4 chunks.

![``info`` VLR and the LAZ chunk table allow COPC readers to select and seek through the file.](copc-vlr-chunk-table-illustration.png)

Data organization of COPC is modeled after the [EPT data
format](https://entwine.io/entwine-point-tile.html), but COPC clusters the
storage of the octree as variably-chunked LAZ data in a single file.  This
allows the data to be consumed sequentially by any reader than can handle
variably-chunked LAZ 1.4 (LASzip, for example), or as a spatial subset for
readers that interpret the COPC hierarchy. More information about the
differences between EPT data and COPC can be found below.

# Notation

Some of the file format is described using C-language [fixed width integer
types](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/types/integer).  Groups of entities are
denoted with a C-language struct, though all data is packed on byte boundaries
and encoded as little-endian values, which may not be the case for a C program
that uses the same notation.

# Implementation

Key aspects distinguish an organized COPC LAZ file from an LAZ 1.4 that is unorganized:

* It *MUST* contain *ONLY* LAS PDRFs 6, 7, or 8 formatted data
* It *MUST* contain a COPC [``info`` VLR](#info-vlr)
* It *MUST* contain a COPC  [``hierarchy`` VLR](#hierarchy-vlr)

## LAS PDRFs 6, 7, or 8

COPC files *MUST* contain data with *ONLY* ASPRS LAS Point Data Record Format 6, 7, or 8. See
the [ASPRS LAS specification](https://github.com/ASPRSorg/LAS) for details.

## ``info`` VLR

| User ID                    | Record ID        |
| -------------------------- | ---------------- |
| ``copc``                   | ``1``            |

The ``info`` VLR *MUST* exist.

The ``info`` VLR *MUST* be the **first** VLR in the file (must begin at offset 375 from
the beginning of the file).

The ``info`` VLR is ``160`` bytes described by the following structure.
``reserved`` elements *MUST* be set to ``0``.

    struct CopcInfo
    {

      // Actual (unscaled) X coordinate of center of octree
      double center_x;

      // Actual (unscaled) Y coordinate of center of octree
      double center_y;

      // Actual (unscaled) Z coordinate of center of octree
      double center_z;

      // Perpendicular distance from the center to any side of the root node.
      double halfsize;

      // Space between points at the root node.
      // This value is halved at each octree level
      double spacing;

      // File offset to the first hierarchy page
      uint64_t root_hier_offset;

      // Size of the first hierarchy page in bytes
      uint64_t root_hier_size;

      // Minimum of GPSTime
      double gpstime_minimum;

      // Maximum of GPSTime
      double gpstime_maximum;

      // Must be 0
      uint64_t reserved[11];
    };



## ``hierarchy`` VLR

| User ID                    | Record ID        |
| -------------------------- | ---------------- |
| ``copc``                   | ``1000``         |

The ``hierarchy`` VLR *MUST* exist.

Like EPT, COPC stores hierarchy information to allow a reader to locate points
that are in a particular octree node.  Also like EPT, the hierarchy *MAY* be
arranged in a tree of pages, but *SHALL* always consist of at least ONE hierarchy
page.

The VLR data consists of one or more hierarchy pages. Each hierarchy data page
is written as follows:

The VoxelKey corresponds to the naming of
[EPT data files](https://entwine.io/entwine-point-tile.html#ept-data).

    struct VoxelKey
    {
      // A value < 0 indicates an invalid VoxelKey
      int32_t level;
      int32_t x;
      int32_t y;
      int32_t z;
    }

An entry corresponds to a single key/value pair in an
[EPT hierarchy](https://entwine.io/entwine-point-tile.html#ept-data),
but contains additional information to allow direct access and decoding of the corresponding
point data.

    struct Entry
    {
      // EPT key of the data to which this entry corresponds
      VoxelKey key;

      // Absolute offset to the data chunk if the pointCount > 0.
      // Absolute offset to a child hierarchy page if the pointCount is -1.
      // 0 if the pointCount is 0.
      uint64_t offset;

      // Size of the data chunk in bytes (compressed size) if the pointCount > 0.
      // Size of the hierarchy page if the pointCount is -1.
      // 0 if the pointCount is 0.
      int32_t byteSize;

      // If > 0, represents the number of points in the data chunk.
      // If -1, indicates the information for this octree node is found in another hierarchy page.
      // If 0, no point data exists for this key, though may exist for child entries.
      int32_t pointCount;
    }


The entries of a hierarchy page are consecutive. The number of entries in a
page can be determined by taking the size of the page (contained in the parent
page as ``Entry::byteSize`` or in the COPC ``info`` VLR as
``CopcData::root_hier_size``) and dividing by the size of an ``Entry`` (32
bytes).

    struct Page
    {
        Entry entries[page_size / 32];
    }



# Differences from EPT

* COPC has no [ept.json](https://entwine.io/entwine-point-tile.html#ept-data). The information
  from ept.json is stored in the LAS file header and LAS VLRs.
* COPC currently provides no support for
  [ept-sources.json](https://entwine.io/entwine-point-tile.html#ept-sources).
  File metadata support may be added in the future.
* COPC only supports the LAZ point format and does not support binary
  point arrangements.
* COPC chunks store only point data as LAZ. EPT, when stored as LAZ, uses complete
  LAZ files including the LAS header and perhaps VLRs.

# Reader Implementation Notes

COPC is designed so that a reader needs to know little about the structure of a LAZ file.
By reading the first 589 bytes (375 for the header + 54 for the COPC VLR header + 160
for the COPC VLR), the software can verify that the file is a COPC file and determine
the point data record format and point data record length, both of which are necessary
to create a LAZ decompressor.

Readers should:
* verify that the first four bytes of the file contain the ASCII characters "LASF".
* verify that the 4 bytes starting at offset 377 contain the characters `copc`.
* verify that the bytes at offsets 393 and 394 contain the values 1 and 0,
  respectively (this is the COPC version number, 1).
* determine the point data record format by reading the byte at offset 104, masking off the
  two high bits, which are used by LAZ to indicate compression, and can be ignored.
* determine the point data record length by reading two bytes at offset 105.

The octree hierarchy is arranged in pages. The COPC VLR provides information describing the
location and size of root hierarchy page.  The root hierarchy page can be used to traverse to
child pages.  Each entry in a hierarchy page either refers to a
child hierarchy page, octree node data chunk, or an empty octree node. The size and
file offset of each data chunk is provided in the hierarchy entries, allowing the chunks
to be directly read for decoding.

# Server Implementation Notes

For streaming of COPC files from HTTP servers to work, the server hosting COPC files needs to be configured to allow:

* [HTTP range requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests)
* [Cross-origin requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) - if other hosts should be allowed to access the data (in web browsers)

# Discussion

## Use Case

[Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF](https://www.cogeo.org/) has shown the utility and convenience
of taking a dominant container format for geospatial raster data and optionally
augmenting its organization to allow incremental "range-read" support over HTTP with it.
With the mantra of "It's just a TIFF" allowing ubiquitous usage of the data content
combined with the flexibility of supporting partial reads over the internet, COG has
found a sweet spot. Its reward is the ongoing rapid conversion of significant raster data
holdings to COG-organized content to enable convenient cloud consumption of the data
throughout the GIS industry.

What is the COG for point clouds? It would need to be similar in fit and scope to
COG:

* Support incremental partial reads over HTTP
* Provide good compression
* Allow dimension-selective reads
* Provide all metadata and supporting information
* Support an [EPT](https://entwine.io/entwine-point-tile.html)-style octree organization for
  data streaming

## "Just a LAZ"

LAZ (LASZip) is the ubiquitous geospatial point cloud format. It is an
augmentation of [ASPRS LAS](https://github.com/ASPRSorg/LAS) that utilizes an
arithmetic encoder to efficiently compress the point content. It has seen a
number of revisions, but the latest supports dimension-selective access and
provides all of the metadata support that normal LAS provides.  Importantly,
multiple software implementations ([laz-rs](https://github.com/laz-rs/laz-rs),
[laz-perf](https://github.com/hobu/laz-perf), and
[LASzip](https://github.com/laszip/laszip)) provide LAZ compression and
decompression, and laz-perf and laz-rs include compilation to JavaScript which
is used by all JavaScript clients when consuming LAZ content.

## Put EPT in LAZ

The EPT content organization supports LAZ in its current "exploded"
organization. Exploded in this context means that each chunk of data at each
octree level is stored as an individual LAZ file (or simple blob, or a
zstd-compressed blob). One consequence of the exploded organization is large
EPT trees of data can mean collections of *millions* of files. In non-cloud
situations, EPT's cost when moving data or deleting it can be significant. Like
the tilesets of late 2000s raster map tiles, lots of little files are a
problem.

LAZ provides a feature that allows concatenation of the individual LAZ files
into a single LAZ file. This is the concept of a dynamically-sized chunk
table. It is a feature that [Martin Isenburg](https://twitter.com/rapidlasso)
envisioned for quad-tree organized data, but it could work the same for an
octree.

# Structural Changes to Draft Specification

* Remove `extents` VLR and put gpstime_minimum and gpstime_maximum in `info` VLR.



# Validation

* An online validator of COPC files is available at [https://validator.copc.io](https://validator.copc.io). Simply drag-n-drop
a (reasonably-sized) COPC file onto the page and it will validate the header information and optionally
allow you to visualize it.

* A C++ utility for verifying COPC metadata is available at [https://github.com/hobuinc/copcverify](https://github.com/hobuinc/copcverify)
